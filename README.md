# FIR Max Object

This object allows a signal to be convolved with a list of FIR Coefficiants.

I made this because I thought the bufir object was too fidly to learn and creatively interact with FIR Filters.

Use this object by sending a signal into it's left inlet and a list of coefficiant values into it's right inlet and imediatly hear it's filtering effect!

This object is bundled inside a stripped down version of the MAX 7 API with an Xcode project for quick building.
